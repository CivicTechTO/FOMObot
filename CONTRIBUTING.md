## Contributing

1. Fork the repo.
2. Make your changes.
3. Add clear documentation of your changes to your commit messages.
4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not
accept, pull requests before they are merged. We may suggest some changes or
improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted,

* Include tests that fail without your code, and pass with it
* Update the documentation, the surrounding one, examples elsewhere, guides,
  whatever is affected by your contribution
* Follow the existing style of the project
